Speech Recognition - using Multiple method for multiple Scenarios

Abstract : 
  There are many principle methods for speech recognition process. Startign for filtering to the classifying model, there are 
  several ways to make it done. In this Project I am implementing a generalised platfom that include several methods in filtering, 
  generalising, Feature vector converting, reducing and language Learning model. Each way has its own advantages and drawback. So 
  this generic platform will adopt on the best optimised accuraccy with difference techniques
